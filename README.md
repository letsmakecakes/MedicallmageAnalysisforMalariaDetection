## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repo
```

3. Install the required dependencies. You can use the following command to install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

5. Open the `malaria_detection.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of blood cell images collected from patients infected with malaria. It can be downloaded from [source URL] and should be placed in the `data` directory.

## Usage

Open the `malaria_detection.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells to run the malaria detection system. The notebook contains step-by-step instructions and explanations.

## Results

After running the notebook, the system will output the results, including the classification accuracy and any detected malaria parasites in the blood cell images.
